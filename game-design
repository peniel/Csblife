topic or the question is : what is the purpose of having lives?

> for me it is because having a lives in a game make the player continue what his/her playing because he/she knew that they have still lives
> having life provides the player with additional chances to try again
> with these lives, the gameplay is longer, and player gets more value out of the game since they extra lives allowed them to automatically continue the gameplay
> having lives becomes fun in a situaton that you like to have more lives because some teenagers now cheat the game in order to have more lives, if the game doesn't have lives may be most of the teenagers nowadays wouldn't appreciate his/her game
