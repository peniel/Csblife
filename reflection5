What is NSTP? National Service Training Program is the meaning of NSTP. ROTC, CWTS and LTS are some of its programs. It aims to promote and integrate values education, transformational leadership, spirit of patriotism and nationalism and sustainable social mobilization for youth development, community building and national security. What the NSTP does in nation-building is to improve in teamwork and unity, in which we can find a way to do something to help everbody not just one person. There are three program components. First is that of ROTC. ROTC(Reserve Officers Training Corps) a training program to prepare college students to be commissioned officers
. Second is that of CWTS. CWTS (Civic Welfare Training Service)
refers to the Program component or activities contributory to the general welfare and the betterment of life for the members of the community or the enhancement of its facilities, especially those devoted to improving health, education, environment, entrepreneurship, safety, recreation and moral citizenry and other social welfare services. Last but not the least, LTS (Literacy Training Service) refers to the Program component designed to train the students to teach literacy and numeracy skills to school children, out-of-school youths and other social welfare services. Among these three programs, I plan to take up CWTS, because, I like it and I love doing it. I don't have much time for teaching other people, in which we should do in LTS. and I am too weak in physical activities that I may not last in ROTC. Taking up at least one NSTP program can help us become a good Filipino. </i>
