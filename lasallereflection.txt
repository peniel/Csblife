"Consider how important it is for you to use your time well. To do so, you must live in an orderly, systematic fashion."
- St. John Baptist de La Salle

How important is time? In an age where everything comes in an instant why do we still have to value time?  How can one live in an orderly systematic way in a chaotic age?

We can't imagine the life that we are leading without the invention of the concept of time and the statement itself says a lot about the importance of time.

Time brings regulation in our life and unless we regulate ourselves we are nor able to do any thing, however talented we are. We can take the case of an artist; no matter how talented he/she is but unless he/she sits for long hours to create, he/she is unable to create anything. 

"We need time. We need time to work, to eat, to sleep, to play, and to accomplish all the daily chores of living. We also need time to know and understand our families  and our friends. We need time for our selves, time to be alone. Most of our relationships, in fact, require more time than we have, and it is difficult to avoid the feeling that we could never have enough. Nor is our list of demands on our time complete.
 
Time is finite. Each of us rich or poor alike has only 24 hours ( maybe the only area that the rich and poor becomes equal) a day and no one else can live our lives for us. 

There are only so many hours in a day, none of which can be reclaimed. How many hours a day do you have left today? Whatever your definition of time management, it can’t be stored, saved or borrowed. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. Truly “Time is Gold”

Consider what is most important to us, is it money?  Studies?  Family? Once we know what we valued the most, what is our priority then this Is where we should spend our precious time. Try to balance everything that we may give equal time to every area of our life.
