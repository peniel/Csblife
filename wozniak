How can I apply Wozniak's system for myself and for this course?
Just follow the steps that allow us to practice memorizing things.

Wozniak system is a set up an algorithm that could help a person remember what he learned.  I can apply this to me or into my course by just simply following the wozniak system, and if i will be able to follow it I can have a high grades in my exams, midterms, and finals, even in recitation you can apply it.
