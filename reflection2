Frosh solidarity night
Frosh solidarity night was a nice and good event for frosh like us because you will be able to know more about your blockmates have fun with them and spend time with them. Of course at first I don’t know what to say to them because I doesn’t even know them to deeper but soon even I doesn’t know them they become my friends and in that event I gained friends and I enjoyed the night. Frosh solidarity night is the welcome party for the frosh students at first im so excited to meet my fellow benildian-lasallian and suddenly the atmosphere changed to fun and joy the rock band group brought us more happiness and enjoyment some people dance some sang with the band some went to the booth to have a pictures with their friends. But whatever it was the point was atleast whatever happened to the frosh solidarity night it make sense because without it we wouldn’t had fun with each other. Just what like they said “ I can study, but you can have fun too while your studying” the night was good the place was night and I can say it’s more that perfect event for a frosh like me. Having fun would prepare you to the real battle of college life. Happiness would lead you to success because if you can’t concentrate to one situation you can’t concentrate to all. So I can say frosh solidarity night was a successful event for us.
