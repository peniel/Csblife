Guide Questions and Reflection for Healed Hearts:

1. Give at least (2) Benildean Core Values shown on the production.
3. How do handle your own grief?
2. How can you share these values to others?
4. How does it affect you as part of the Lasallian community?
5. Give your own personal insights about the show.

 there are Benildean Core Values presented In this event or program. One is that of Social Responsibility especially for others, in which we should be sensitive of others' needs and not only your own needs, because in a way, it will affect your yourself, behaviour and everything about you. Another is we should have deeper Faith in God, in which whatever problems you have share it with God and God will help you. Yes your family can help you but God is your All in All so His the one you should lean on. God will talk to you, because He will always be there for you. I can share this things to my fellow benildian-lasallian or even in my friends outside the campus, or in every person that I know.
