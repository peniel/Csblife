Guide Questions and Reflection for Karilyo:

1. What can you do to prevent what happened in the 2nd part of the story?
2. How does it affect you as part of the Lasallian community ?
3. Give at least 2 Benildean Core Values shown on the production 
4. How can you share these values to others?
5. Give your own personal insights about the play

In the second part of the play, one can prevent this by being a good to the environment, the animals and the people around you. You should know how to plant trees and throw your garbage in the proper places. Keep everything balanced. As part of the La Sallian community,and as being a benildian-lasallian student I am encouraged to serve as a model in being a good to mother earth, because in the story, what happened was that everything was destroyed. What God slowly and preciously created was destroyed and to prevent this is to prevent and stop pollution and throwing garbage in everywhere they want. Another insight is that one can see some Benildean Core Values like Social Responsibility, in which we should be responsible to everything around us not only to the people but to the non-living things surrounding us and Deeply Rooted in Faith, in which we should not always lose hope in problems like pollution and such because such problems were given to us as a test from God, because, He wants us to take care of His creations. He want us to take care of his creation
